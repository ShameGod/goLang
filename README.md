Golang notes from tutorials 

## Introduction to Go lang 
### object oriented : 
Golang is an object oriented. Golang doesn't use the term *class* it uses *structs* 
The structs in Golang are very simplified, it doesn't have **Inheritance**, **constructors** nor **generics**. Which make the golang code simple and quick to run. 
### Concurrency : 
The motivation of concurrency is the need of speed. Concurrency is here to over come the **performance limitation**. 
Moure's law says : Number of transistors doubles every 18months. But that's not the case anymore. We arrived to the limits of hardware optimisation (except for the case of quantum computers). 
In order to go faster with the same hardware we have two solutions : 
*  parallelism : add more cores but it is very difficult to program (conflicts, sharing resources between threads ..)
*  Concurrency : management of many tasks in the same time. It enables parallelism. It is exactly like parallelism but without the drawbacks. So concurrency would have : *synchronization and communication between tasks*  [needs more explenation]
